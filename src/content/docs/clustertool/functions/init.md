:::caution[Work In Progress]

This program, all its features and its general design, are all a Work-In-Progress.
Not done and even not widely available.

All code and docs are considered Pre-Alpha Drafts

:::

ClusterTool requires a specific directory layout to ensure smooth operators and standardised environments.

To ensure smooth deployment, the init function can pre-generate all required files in the right places.
Afterwards you can edit talconfig.yaml and talenv.yaml to reflect your personal settings.

When done, please run clustertool genconfig to generate all configarion based on your personal settings
