**PRE RELEASE VERSION, EARLY DRAFT, DO NOT RELY ON THIS**

We're glad to announce that shortly after 01-01-2024, we will release a big update to all our Apps.
This will, yet again, be a complex update that technically has a few changes that might break some specific features for some users. 
While we do not forsee any dataloss, it's imperative to backup your data

## Standardisation of PVC storage



## Introducing: Static PVC Storage




## Redesign of Cloudnative-PG



## Backup that Postgresql Database!

**On SCALE**
