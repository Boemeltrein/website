By leveraging smart contracts, client-side encryption, and sophisticated redundancy (via Reed-Solomon codes), Sia allows users to safely store their data with hosts that they do not know or trust. The result is a cloud storage marketplace where hosts compete to offer the best service at the lowest price. And since there is no barrier to entry for hosts, anyone with spare storage capacity can join the network and start making money.","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/sia-daemon.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/sia-daemon","train":"stable","version":"4.1.9"},{"name":"sickchill","description":"An Automatic Video Library Manager for TV Shows","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/sickchill.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/sickchill","train":"stable","version":"10.0.5"},{"name":"sickgear","description":"Provides management of TV shows and/or Anime, it detects new episodes, links downloader apps, and more","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/sickgear.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/sickgear","train":"stable","version":"10.1.9"},{"name":"simply-shorten","description":"A dead simple URL shortener.","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/simply-shorten.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/simply-shorten","train":"stable","version":"7.1.9"},{"name":"sinusbot","description":"SinusBot is a MusicBot that will let you listen to music together with your friends on either TeamSpeak 3 or Discord.","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/sinusbot.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/sinusbot","train":"stable","version":"4.1.9"},{"name":"slack-invite","description":"Creates a simple webpage for Slack invite signups","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/slack-invite.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/slack-invite","train":"stable","version":"4.1.9"},{"name":"slash","description":"A bookmarking and link shortening service that enables easy saving and sharing of links.","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/slash.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/slash","train":"stable","version":"2.1.10"},{"name":"smokeping","description":"Keep track of your network latency.","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/smokeping.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/smokeping","train":"stable","version":"9.1.13"},{"name":"smtp-relay","description":"A SMTP service for relaying emails.","icon":"https://truecharts.org/img/hotlink-ok/chart-icons/smtp-relay.png","link":"https://truecharts.org/charts/stable/smtp-relay","train":"stable","version":"2.1.11"},{"name":"snapdrop","description":"Snapdrop A local file sharing in your browser.
